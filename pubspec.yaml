# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/splash_logo.png
    - assets/images/ic_splash_main.webp
    - assets/images/ic_walkthrough_1.PNG
    - assets/images/ic_walkthrough_2.PNG
    - assets/images/ic_walkthrough_3.PNG
    - assets/icons/ic_logo_facebook.PNG
    - assets/icons/google-plus.png
    - assets/icons/ic_profile_female.PNG
    - assets/icons/ic_profile_male.PNG
    - assets/icons/ic_mail_password.PNG
    - assets/images/temp/ic_temp_1.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins_regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins_semibold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins_medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins_bold.ttf

#    - family: Savoye LET
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/savoyeletplain.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
